<h1>HEY FRIENDS</h1>
<h2>Hello</h2>
<p>Once you unzip the file, you will find a folder named Bootstrap4 created in your computer. Inside the Bootstrap4 folder, you will see another folder named conFusion, there. Go into the conFusion folder and you would see two files there, index.html and package.json file.</p>
<h2>Hiii</h2>
<p>So this is to ensure that when you do a gitcommit, the node_modules folder will not be committed. After that, it is time to go and fetch Bootstrap for use in our project. Before we fetch Bootstrap, let's do a commit of the current state of the file. So, do git init and initialize your git repository. Then you can check git status, and you would see that these files need to be committed, add all the files, gitcommit -m "Initial Setup". So this is the starting point of your folder at this moment. So, with this, your starting point of your web project has been now committed to git. Now you can set up this git to synchronize with an online repository, just like we talked about in the git exercises. </p>
